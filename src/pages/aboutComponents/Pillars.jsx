                            Nutrition is a critical part of wellness. People with adequate nutrition are more productive
                            and  can create opportunities to gradually break unhealthy habits. Healthy eating is not hard 
                            but what makes it hard is the lack of education around it. Not having the knowledge around 
                            the healthy substitutes or even an understanding of what our food contains makes it a 
                            frustrating process for many.
